Exercise: Dynamic Array Operations

Objective:
Implement a program that performs dynamic array operations, such as creation, insertion, deletion, and display.

Requirements:

    Write a function to create a dynamic array of integers. The function should take the size of the array as an argument and return a pointer to the dynamically allocated memory.
    Write a function to insert an element at a specified position in the array. Ensure that the array size is dynamically adjusted to accommodate the new element.
    Write a function to delete an element from a specified position in the array. Ensure that the array size is adjusted accordingly.
    Write a function to display the elements of the dynamic array.
    Create a menu-driven program that allows the user to perform these operations interactively until they choose to exit.
